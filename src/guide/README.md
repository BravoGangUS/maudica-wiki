*NOTE: If you have an old version of MelonLoader you will instead see an UPDATE button and if you already have the current version of MelonLoader you will see a RE-INSTALL button.*

## How To Make Custom Songs

The main two options for custom songs are Reaper and NotReaper.

### NotReaper

NotReaper is a community made mapper designed to be more easy to pick up and map with, especially for new people.

Its first instance was as Audica Editor by Rolo, which was forked by Cameron and became Edica. Then all development stopped so CircuitLord picked it up and then it became NotReaper.

It is still in active development, with new features being added all the time to make it more and more close to the efficiency of Reaper.

### Reaper

Reaper is the official tool used by Harmonix to make their songs. However, it is pretty advanced. If you're already comfortable in DAWs and don't mind the learning curve, Reaper is probably the choice for you.
