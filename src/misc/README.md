## Scoring

This page is mostly a copy paste of this
[guide](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1725944274)
made by drasticsurgeon (anticrepuscular in the [Harmonix discord
server](https://discord.gg/Harmonix)).

### Introduction

Audica has a fairly complex scoring system. This guide breaks down how
the scores are calculated for each target type and also covers the
multiplier system.

The details below are based on playing the game and watching recordings,
along with comments from the developers.

### Standard/Slot Targets

Standard and slot (horizontal/vertical) targets use the same scoring
system. They're worth up to 2000 points each:

| Base | Timing | Aim | Total |
| ---- | ------ | --- | ----- |
| 500  | 750    | 750 | 2000  |

### Sustain Targets

Sustain targets are worth up to 3000 points each. Base/Timing/Aim give
the same points as for standard targets, depending on how you hit the
target at the start of the sustain.

Hold points are given for keeping the trigger pressed until the end of
the sustain (or later). Note that you don't have to release the trigger
"on time"; you can keep it pressed past the end of the sustain and still
get the maximum.

After the initial hit of a sustain target there are no further points
for aim. This means you can start aiming at the next target early, or
just rest your arm for a while\!

Sustain targets are added to your streak upon the initial hit, but the
points are not added until the end of the sustain.

| Base | Timing | Aim | Hold | Total |
| ---- | ------ | --- | ---- | ----- |
| 500  | 750    | 750 | 1000 | 3000  |

### Chain Targets

Chain targets begin with a start target and continue with sub-targets.
You have to shoot the chain start target and keep the trigger pressed
until the chain is finished. The gun will autofire at the sub-targets in
time with the music.

The chain start target is scored in exactly the same way as a standard
target:

| Base | Timing | Aim | Total |
| ---- | ------ | --- | ----- |
| 500  | 750    | 750 | 2000  |

The chain sub-targets are scored lower because they're more frequent.
There's no timing component to the score because the gun automatically
fires to hit them on time.

| Base | Aim | Total |
| ---- | --- | ----- |
| 50   | 75  | 125   |

### Melee Targets

Melee targets are worth up to 2000 points each. To get full points for
velocity you need to be moving the controller faster than the (unknown)
speed threshold for at least 0.1 seconds. This is checked during a 0.2
second window around the arrival time of the melee target.

| Base | Velocity | Total |
| ---- | -------- | ----- |
| 1000 | 1000     | 2000  |

### Streak/Multiplier System

The game tracks how many consecutive targets you've hit without missing
or misfiring; this is your streak count. Releasing the trigger before
the end of a sustain or chain target will reset your streak count too.

A multiplier is applied to target scores based on your streak count:

| Streak Count | Multiplier |
| ------------ | ---------- |
| 1-9          | 1x         |
| 10-19        | 2x         |
| 20-29        | 3x         |
| 30+          | 4x         |

The streak count is updated before the points for the target are
applied, so the 10th target you hit in a streak gets a 2x multiplier.

### Stars cutoff

Stars are calculated based on the max possible score. You have to reach
a certain percentage.

| Stars              | Percentage |
| ------------------ | ---------- |
| Gold (Expert Only) | \>90%      |
| Five               | \>63.5%    |
| Four               | \>42.5%    |
| Three              | \>26.5%    |
| Two                | \>10%      |
| One                | \>0%       |

## Grid Sphere

Each rectangle on this grid represents a pitch in the cues and midi
files.

It is possible to go beyond the grid and create a 360 degrees map/chart
by using big offset numbers in the cues file or the big offset CC values
in the MIDI file.

There is also grid spots at the top and bottom of the normal grid, even
though they're not shown in these pictures. There is 5 rows above and 8
rows below that people can use with target offsets.
